Welcome to the Harimindscape Chatbot project! This chatbot, lovingly named "harimindscape," is designed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Whether you're exploring its functionality or interested in enhancing its capabilities, you've come to the right place.

## Project Structure

Here's a quick overview of the project's file structure:


- `app.py`: The main application script.
- `intents.json`: Data for training the chatbot.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for the project.
- `training.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for training the chatbot.
